# Spotify search

This is a basic webpage using mostly jQuery and [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) for some basic styling that uses the Spotify API to search for albums, artists, or playlists.

Clicking on the search results leads to the relevant Spotify pages.

### Getting started

Because this page does not use any libraries outside of those mentioned above, you can simply open the `index.html` file in the browser to test it out. There is also a live demo running here: http://dnzhng.com/spotify-search.
